I got on the Pokémon Go hype train the day it was released. I was always a fan of Pokémon growing up and seeing a mobile app being released for free was a big deal.

Although there has been lots of problems with the app, the community has not been addressed by Niantic and people are growing restless.
Don’t get me wrong though, the app is still amazing and has pioneered an intuitive and mobile AR gaming experience.
The problems gave a lot of opportunity for others to take advantage of the market. One app called PokeVision lets you scan around you to help you find pokémon you want.

This addresses the huge problem with Go which is the tracker does not work at all. This is an application that meets a customer needs.
That’s what we are trying to accomplish with Pokémon Yo. We want to build a community where trainers can find other pokémon to trade locally.
